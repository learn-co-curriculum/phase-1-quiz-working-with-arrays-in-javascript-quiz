# Arrays: map

I have the following array of my favorite artists, and want to add a number in
front of each, to create a number list. What method is the best to achieve this?

```javascript
const artists = ["Janelle Monae", "Sza", "Thunder Cat", "Frank Ocean"];

const numberedArtists = artists. _______ (function (artist, index) {
  return `${index + 1}. ${artist}`;
});
console.log(numberedArtists);
// => ["1. Janelle Monae", "2. Sza", "3. Thunder Cat", "4. Frank Ocean"]
```

Fill in the blank in the code above.

## Correct
