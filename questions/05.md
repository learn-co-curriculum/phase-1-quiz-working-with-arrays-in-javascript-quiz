# Arrays: forEach

Select all that apply. The best use cases for the `forEach()` method are:

## Correct

To iterate over an array and directly mutate elements.

> Correct!
>
> We can use `forEach()` to iterate over every element in an array, and*do
> something* to each of them!

## Correct

To iterate through an array to log values.

> Correct!
>
> `forEach()` is great for logging all the values in an array!

## Incorrect

To create a new array with updates to our original elements.

> While we could create a new empty array and then use `forEach()` to push
> updated elements from a different array into it, there are a few other
> iterators that can do this job a little better for us.
> [Check out `.map()`](https://learning.flatironschool.com/courses/3297/pages/mapping-arrays?module_item_id=143585),
> for instance!

## Incorrect

I don't know.
