# Arrays: forEach

Select all that apply. Use cases for which the `forEach()` method would be
appropriate are:

## Correct

To iterate over an array and directly mutate elements.

> Correct!
> 
> We can use `forEach()` to iterate over every element in an array, and\*do
> something\* to each of them!

## Correct

To iterate through an array to log values.

> Correct!
> 
> `forEach()` is great for logging all the values in an array!

## Incorrect

To create a new array with updates to our original elements.

> While we could create a new empty array and then use `forEach()` to push updated
> elements from a different array into it, there are a few other iterators that
> can do this job a little better for us. [Check
> out`.map()`](/courses/7550/pages/mapping-arrays?module_item_id=627514), for
> instance!

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
