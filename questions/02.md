# Arrays: find

I have a list of all my favorite artists, and am searching for **the
first**artist that starts with S. What is the best method to achieve this?

```javascript
let artists = [
  "Smash Mouth",
  "Janelle Monae",
  "SZA",
  "Thunder Cat",
  "Frank Ocean",
  "Solange",
];

artists. _________ (function (artist) {
  return artist.startsWith("S");
});
```

Fill in the blank in the code above.

## Correct
